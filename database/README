In order to put it on UWE mysql, you will need to comment out:

CREATE DATABASE  IF NOT EXISTS `ESD` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 */;
USE `ESD`;

as well as any line with LOCK and UNLOCK

It seems that we havent got sufficient credentials in order to use these commands.

I have also put it on my fet11000746 acc, in order to access it (according to UWE):

MySQL and PHP

The connection details for a PHP script will require:

    host : stocks
    user : CEMS username  (the unix one with no hyphen)
    password : allocated password 

When connected, you must select a database:

    database : CEMS username


So it would be:

host : stocks
user : s2timofejevs (not sure, could also try s2-timofejevs or fet11000746)
password: dtcnbr
