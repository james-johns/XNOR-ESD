For information how to connect to database please refer to:
http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/sql/mysql/

You can create the database via PHPMYADMIN on UWE:
http://stocks.cems.uwe.ac.uk/phpmyadmin/

Username is: fet<your student id>
password is: <whatever you have chosen>

To change the password, or create an accaunt:

Importing SQL dump is straight forward, just clock on import (in PHPMYADMIN), and choose
an SQL dump file (*.sql).

Alternatively, you can ask me for my credentials (not leaving them here anymore ;) ).
