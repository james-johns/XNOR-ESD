Getting started
----------------

Buildroot
----------------

To begin, you will need to checkout the submodules for this repository.
Run the following commands:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

This will initialise and checkout all submodules for the current branch. 
From here, you can continue development as always, using an agreed upon version
of each submodule.


Directory structure
------------------------

	configs/       - contains configuration files for all components of the
		       	 system
	patches/       - Contains patches to be applied to packages within buildroot
		       	 during build process
	buildroot/     - Location of buildroot submodule. See above for how to
		       	 checkout working copy.
